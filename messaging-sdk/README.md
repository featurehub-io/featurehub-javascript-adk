# FeatureHub Typescript Messaging API SDK

This SDK provides prebuilt models to parse and understand what the data model looks like
that comes from the Messaging API. The Messaging API is published when someone changes an 
individual Feature and is a complete diff of that feature against the previous version. As
such it is a fairly complicated model.

Documentation is provided in the model code.

The release of this artifact tracks the API release.
