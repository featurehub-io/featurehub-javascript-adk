# FeatureHub Javascript Admin SDK

This is the Admin SDK conveniently built as a npm module for Javascript. It is simply the
OpenAPI definitions. For more ideas on how it can be used, please visit our https://docs.featurehub.io/featurehub/latest/admin-development-kit.html[documentation].

The release of this artifact tracks the API release.
          
Notes on Changelog:

- 1.2.1  - in this release we moved Axios to a development dependency so developers don't need to
worry about this library dictating the Axios version.
